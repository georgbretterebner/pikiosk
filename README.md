Pi Kiosk - A collection of files to use a RasPi as a Kiosk device for a webpage

Contains udev Rules and hwdb files for calibration and adjustment of 3M EXII Touch controller that we have lying around and use as a control dashboard.

In it's current form it uses Cage compositor and Chromium Embedded Framework as the interface.

To install on a RasPi, run prepare.sh and follow the install script.
